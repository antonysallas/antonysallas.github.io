# Prompt

You are an expert web designer and developer, I would like to recreate the website design that I have provided in the attached image using HTML and CSS and needs to be responsive as well. The website belongs to my company, Heights Pte. Ltd, and it serves as an application to view the monthly revenue of my Fitness Club, New Joinees, and projected revenue for the upcoming month.
This is my logo for the website <https://ibb.co/qmDpX5K>. The Web Application has several screens. I will provide one screen at a time. You should not use the same content. Change the content that aligns to my brand. Provide me the code and guide on where to integrate it.

Here is Screen 1:
There are 2 sections in the attached image, Such as Brand Logo and Login Form.

You can use online svg for icons if required from Font awesome. Please use this colour palette to match the colour schemes. <https://coolors.co/palette/03045e-0077b6-00b4d8-90e0ef-caf0f8>

Feel free to choose fonts that align with our brand identity and apply your expertise to enhance the overall styling of the website. I intend to use the CodePen application for copying and pasting the code. Please advise me on what to name the HTML and CSS files.

To begin, please ask any essential questions that will help you better understand the website design. Letâ€™s communicate in English for this project.

Here is Screen 2:

1. User icon in the corner: Upon clicking the user icon, the user is taken to the another page where the user profile is displayed. The user can also update their details from that screen
